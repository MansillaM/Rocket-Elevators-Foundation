<b>Consolidation Week!</b>

<br>

You will need this for my project:

  - Ruby version 2.6.7
  - Rails version 5.2.8
  - Once on the intervention page press F5 to refresh the page.(special add-on)
 
<br>

For this weeks project I created a new intervention page, a new intervention form, a new intervention table for Mysql database, implemented a FreshDesk api to my form ans ofcourse some REST api's on the DotNet framework.

<br>

Please go the the intervention page and complete the intervention ticket which will be sent to our people in FreshDesk as a Incident ticket type. 
Once completed the data will also be sent to my database table called 'Intervention'.
